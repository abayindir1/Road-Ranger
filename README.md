# Project-## Problem: This app will address the need to offer location based alerts to drivers and shoppers that are relevant to their map position, and makes use of a lean and effective UI that is hands-free, and voice based, creating an app specifically suited for safe use on roads.

Technology Requirements:

voice to text
positioning
access to phone microphone
database to store users
a clean and polished UI to add alerts in a hands free way

This app allows for alerts to be posted, which will then be shared with everyone who has the app running. The intent is to make it easy and hands free to hear relevant alerts (1-10) miles radius configurable, and to allow easy finding of the location that is alerted. As an alternative to Waze, it is leaner, and more usable with other software, like google maps.
